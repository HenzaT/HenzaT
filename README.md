## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Developer with a background in education. 
My passion for tech began when I started recording and producing music - I was fascinated by how the DAW (digital audio workstation) worked, and the creativity behind the designs of the plugins. 
Wanting to understand the technology in a deeper way and to learn how to build products myself, I enrolled in a web development course. 
I work with a range of technologies and am always eager to explore and learn new tools. My core strengths include TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, CSS, React and SQL and I am currently expanding my skillset by learning Python.
My experience as a teacher has equipped me with clear communication, leadership, and collaboration skills - qualities I bring to every team and project I’m part of.

When I'm not coding, you’ll likely find me at a climbing gym or writing music.
