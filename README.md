## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Developer with a background in education. I'm passionate about building user-centered products that combine smooth, interactive UI/UX with robust backend architectures designed to support and enhance the user experience. I recently completed Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp and I am actively looking for software engineering roles.
As well as web development, I write and produce music.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 'The Country Club', a web app that tracks the countries you've visited and shares fun, informative facts about each one.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js and about AWS.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am half Japanese!
